# **Viewing All Transactions Made**

Follow these steps to view all transactions made using your API key:

---

## **1. Use Your Own API Key**

Ensure you are using your own generated API key. If you are using the free "try-it-out" key, you will not be able to filter or have an overview of all your transactions since others may also be using the same key.



## **2. Access Your API Dashboard**

1. Navigate to [Stability Protocol API Dashboard](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com/keys/).
2. Select the API key you used for submitting transactions.
